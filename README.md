# btd6farmer - a bot for Bloons Td 6
#### Inspired from [RavingSmurfGB](https://github.com/RavingSmurfGB/Py_AutoBloons), some functions is taken from that repository.
[![Python application](https://github.com/linus-jansson/btd6farmer/actions/workflows/check_bot.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/linus-jansson/btd6farmer/actions/workflows/check_bot.yml)
\
v1.0.0-pre_release

NOTE: Since this is a ***"pre release"*** of the bot. I have yet not tested the functionallty of the bot on anything else than a 1440p monitor. This may have a impact on the new current round system, I have however, added a fallback method to use the old method of finding the current round if the new way fails. If you have any issues with the bot, find any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements, please create an issue or create a pull request!

This python bot will farm a level (dark castle on hard mode by default) in Bloons TD 6. It uses tesseract to find the current level and is able to navigate autonomously after starting it.

*The script is made for 1440p screen resolutions but should also work with 1080p thanks to RacingSmurfGB* =)

*Currently there is no support for linux and proton*

Feel free to make a pull request if you find any improvements or create a issue if something isn't working correctly!

<a name="dependenices"/>

## Requirements & Dependencies
- Windows
- Tesseract v5.0+
- Python 3.10+

```
keyboard==0.13.5
mouse==0.7.1
mss==6.1.0
numpy==1.22.3
opencv_python==4.5.5.64
pytesseract==0.3.9
```
<a name="installation"/>

## Installation of dependencies:
The script relies on tesseract which can be installed using this [this](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) guide. 
(*If by any chance the tesseract installation directory is different from the directory specified in bot.py you need to manually change that in the script. Otherwise the bot will not work!*)

default path:
```py
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
```

After installing tesseract the other requirments can be installed with\
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` \
or running `Install_Requirements.bat`

<a name="running"/>

## Running the bot
1. Open up BTD 6 and run the main.py script in the command line with `py <location of script>/main.py <directory to gameplan>` or run `run.bat` to run with the default settings and gameplan.
2. Navigate to the homescreen of BTD 6 within 5 seconds of starting the script.

### Bot Launch options
- `--debug` -
- `--verbose` -
- `--sandbox` -
- `--gameplan_path` - the path to the gameplan directory

<a name="roadmap"/>

### Roadmap
At the moment the major parts of being able to create own gameplans are done. Current things that needs to be done is:
- [ ] Support for different hero abilities
- [ ] Easier way to create gameplans




<a name="issues"/>

## Having issues with the bot?
If you have any issues with the bot, find any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements, please create an issue or create a pull request!

<a name="contributing"/>

## Creating your own gameplans
You are really welcome to create your own gameplans using your own stratergies and submiting them to the repo with a pull request. I will add it to the repository after testing!

__*NOTE: AS THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS I MAY CHANGE THE GUIDE AND LAYOUT OF THE GAMEPLAN IN THE FUTURE FOR EASE OF USE.*__

__*I also have plans for the future to make it easier to create gameplans so if you want to wait until you create yours you can wait too*__

<a name="setup_file"/>

### setup.py
The setup file is used for the bot to know which hero, map, difficulty and gamemode it should use.
It should be named `setup.py` and be placed in the same directory as the gameplan.

```json
{
    "VERSION": "1",
    "HERO": "OBYN",
    "MAP": "DARK_CASTLE",
    "DIFFICULTY": "HARD_MODE",
    "GAMEMODE": "STANDARD_GAME_MODE",
    "OPTIONS": { // TODO: Add options
        "COLLECT_BANANAS": true,
        "OPEN_CHEST": true,
    }
}
```
>`VERSION` - Use version 1 for now\
> `Hero` - Which hero to use *[list of avaliable heros](#heros)*  \
> `MAP` - Which map to use *[list of avaliable maps](#maps)* \
> `DIFFICULTY` - Which Difficulty to use *[list of avaliable difficultues](#difficulties)* \
> `GAMEMODE` - Which Gamemode to use *[list of avaliable Gamemodes](#gamemodes)* \
###### OPTIONS
> `COLLECT_BANANAS` - If the bot should automatically pick up bananas from traps and bananafarms \
> `OPEN_CHEST` - If the bot should automatically open chests if its unopened on the main menu

### instructions.json
#### Creating the gameplan 
The gameplan is a json file that contains the round as a key and the value as an array with instructions. The instructions is also a json object:

#### instructions.json example
```json
{
    "3": [
        {
            "INSTRUCTION_TYPE": "PLACE_TOWER",
            "ARGUMENTS": {
                "TOWER": "TOWER_TYPE",
                "POSITION": [ x, y ]
            }
        },
        {
            "INSTRUCTION_TYPE": "START",
            "ARGUMENTS": {
                "FAST_FORWARD": true,
            }
        }
    ]
}

```
##### instruction types
- `START` - Indicates the game
    - `FAST_FORWARD` - (true / false) Defaults to True. Should the bot play in fast forward mode?
- `PLACE_TOWER` - Place a tower on the map
    - `MONKEY` - Type of monkey to place 
    - `LOCATION` - [x, y] position of tower to be placed 
- `UPGRADE_TOWER` - Upgrade a tower on the map
    - `LOCATION` - [x, y]  position of tower to be upgraded
    - `UPGRADE_PATH` - [top, middle, bottom] array of upgrades eg [1, 0, 1]
- `CHANGE_TARGET` - changes target of a tower
    - `LOCATION` - [x, y] location of the tower
    - `TARGET` - target or targets eg [ "FIRST", "LAST", "STRONG" ]. Can be a string or a array of targets
    - `TYPE` - (SPIKE or REGULAR) # TODO: add support for Heli targets
    - `DELAY` - (optional) Defaults to 3 delay between each target change, can be one delay eg `2` for 2 seconds or multiple `[1, 3, 4]` to sleep for 1 second, 3 seconds and 4 seconds respectively for each target change.
- `REMOVE_TOWER` - Removes a tower
    - `LOCATION` - [x, y] location of the tower
- `SET_STATIC_TARGET`
    - `LOCATION` - [x, y] location of tower
    - `TARGET_LOCATION` - [x, y] location of target
- `END` - (OPTIONAL) Finished instructions


An instruction array in a round can have multiple objects that will be executed after each other. for example:
```json

```

#### Creating the gameplan in excel and converting to json

### Getting the position of a tower or the target position.
An easy way to get the position of the tower or the target you want, is to use the following code:
```py
import mouse, time

while True:
    print(mouse.get_position())
    time.sleep(0.1)
```
Run it in a terminal and copy the decired position into the gameplan.
